# rloleSportsBot
A discord bot for r/LeagueOfLegends discord server.

# How to use the bot
1. Create the team based roles with their tags.  
(TSM, IMT, C9, G2, MSF, FNC, EDG, RNG, WE, LZ, SKT, SSG, FW, AHQ, GAM, FB)

2. Give the bot manage roles permission, manage user name and set up a exclusive channel #worlds-roles

3. Remove the bot permissions to read other channels except #worlds-roles (We don't want it to react in general or other chats, as it would result into spam)

+cheer [Team] The bot will check if the users has a teamrole already, if that the case the bot will private message people saying Please remove your current existing teamrole. The bot now also change the username to represent the team tag. ex. TSM role give now also [TSM] before the user name
It also reacts with a X and a :envelope: to say the command didn't went through and he sent a direct message.  
 
-cheer [Team] The bot will remove the player role in the command and react to it if it done. (blue check box)
It also reset the username to their discord name. Please mention that to the user so they know that. (Might do a private message for that)

=help The bot will private message the users with the avaible roles. With a command list and a special message which says That this bot exists only for Worlds 2017  

=test Is a Discord Mod user only command. It only exist to check if the bot is working or not.
